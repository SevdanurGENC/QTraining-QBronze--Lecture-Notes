    "Oracle function $f$ depends on the problem you want to solve. You can model many different problems (such as graph coloring, traveling salesman and many more) as a search problem. Elements in your search space correspond to quantum states. Instead of searching the whole space, you design $f$ so that it checks whether an element in the search space is the actual solution and marks it by outputing 1. Then you can use Grover's search to find the solution. "

Our elements in the search space are $\\ket{00}$, $\\ket{01}$, $\\ket{10}$, $\\ket{11}$ and suppose that we want to mark the element $\\ket{11}$. This means that the function should output 1 if the input qubits are in state 1. This can be simply accomplished with the following function:"
